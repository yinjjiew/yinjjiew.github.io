You can deploy <strong>OpenClaw anywhere you want</strong>: on your laptop, on your own server, or in the cloud. Use it however you like. Chat with it, ask it to browse, automate workflows, or help with daily tasks. As long as the model is <strong>hosted by our RL server</strong>, your real interactions can become training signal. The agent does not just respond to you, it <strong>learns from you</strong>. The RL backend continuously collects trajectories, extracts feedback, scores behavior, and updates the model in the background, so the more you use it, the more it adapts to your own habits and preferences. Because the full stack is self-hosted, OpenClaw-RL is also <strong>private by design</strong>: your model is deployed by you, your data stays with you, and the optimization loop is driven entirely by your feedback. <a href="https://github.com/Gen-Verse/OpenClaw-RL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repository</a> is here.</p> <video controls="" preload="metadata" width="100%" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"> <source src="/assets/img/openclawrldemo.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <p><br> <br></p> <h5 id="why-fully-asynchronous">Why Fully Asynchronous</h5> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/openclawrlasync-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/openclawrlasync-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/openclawrlasync-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/openclawrlasync.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 w-75 mx-auto d-block" width="auto" height="auto" title="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>You don’t want a learning system slows down the product, breaks the API, or interrupts the user. That is why OpenClaw-RL is built around a <strong>fully asynchronous RL framework</strong> that decouples <strong>OpenClaw</strong>, <strong>policy serving</strong>, <strong>PRM / judge models</strong>, and <strong>training workers</strong>, so they do not block one another. As soon as enough usable trajectories have been collected, training starts automatically in the background, while the live agent continues serving requests as usual. Rollout, scoring, and gradient updates proceed concurrently, which means optimization continuously improves the model without interrupting the actual use of the agent.</p> <p><br> <br></p> <h5 id="training-method-1-binary-reward-from-user-and-environment-feedback">Training Method 1: Binary Reward from User and Environment Feedback</h5> <p>Our first training path converts naturally occurring user or environment feedback into a simple binary process reward. For each main-line turn, the policy model generates a response and records token-level log-probabilities; when the next user or environment message arrives, we treat it as feedback on the previous turn. A Process Reward Model (PRM) evaluates the pair multiple times, votes whether the previous response was good, bad, or neutral, and uses the majority vote as the scalar reward for that turn.</p> \[r \in \{-1, 0, +1\}\] <p>We then broadcast this scalar reward across all response tokens:</p> \[A_t = r\] <p>The policy is optimized with a PPO-style clipped objective:</p> \[\rho_t = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t \mid s_t)}{\pi_{\text{old}}(a_t \mid s_t)}\] \[\mathcal{L}_{\text{pg}} = -\mathbb{E}_t\left[\min\big(\rho_t A_t,\ \mathrm{clip}(\rho_t, 1-\varepsilon, 1+\varepsilon_{\text{high}}) A_t\big)\right]\] <p>and the total loss is</p> \[\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{pg}} + \beta_{\text{KL}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}}.\] <p>This signal is easy to collect during normal use and gives dense supervision without any manual annotation, although it remains coarse: it tells the model whether a response was good or bad, but not exactly how to improve. In practice, this method works best when users provide frequent lightweight feedback, such as simple approval or disapproval.</p> <p><br> <br></p> <h5 id="training-method-2-on-policy-distillation-with-hindsight-hints">Training Method 2: On-Policy Distillation with Hindsight Hints</h5> <p>Our second training path extracts <strong>textual hindsight hints</strong> from the next state and turns them into a stronger, more directional training signal. For each main-line turn, the policy model first responds to the original prompt; when the next state arrives, a judge model determines whether it contains useful hindsight, and if so, it extracts a short textual hint describing what the model should have done differently. We then append that hint to the original prompt to form an enhanced prompt, run the original response under this enhanced prompt to obtain a stronger teacher distribution, and train the student policy toward that teacher.</p> <p>This gives a token-level advantage defined by the teacher-student log-probability gap:</p> \[A_t = \log\pi_{\text{teacher}}(a_t \mid s + \text{hint}) - \log\pi_\theta(a_t \mid s)\] <p>We use the same PPO-style clipped surrogate. Unlike binary rewards, these textual signals are richer and directional: they do not just tell the model that something went wrong, they tell the model what to change. In practice, this method works best when users provide more concrete feedback, such as what the model should or should not do.</p> <p><br> <br></p> <h5 id="why-computer-use-agents">Why Computer-Use Agents</h5> <p>The most important agents are not just chatbots. They are agents that can actually do useful work.</p> <p>This repository is built to make reinforcement learning practical for <strong>useful computer-use agents</strong> in real deployment. Computer-use agents naturally generate grounded feedback during real execution, which makes them an ideal setting for continuous online optimization. Our roadmap is centered on turning that feedback into better behavior at scale.</p> <h5 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h5> <p>Our long-term goal is to advance <strong>personalized, practically useful agents</strong> with reinforcement learning. The roadmap has two tracks.</p> <p>The first track focuses on <strong>personal agent optimization</strong>: building agents that improve directly from the interaction patterns of individual users. We have already released <strong>v1 of OpenClaw-RL</strong>, including a fully asynchronous RL framework and two automatic optimization methods based on binary and textual feedback. From here, we plan to expand model support, improve serving efficiency, identify stronger optimization recipes through large-scale experiments and real user feedback, and eventually extend learning beyond the policy itself to components such as skills and memory.</p> <p>The second track focuses on <strong>general agents optimization</strong>: scaling the same ideas into broader agentic RL infrastructure. Our next milestone, planned for the next <strong>2–3 weeks</strong>, is to release scalable RL infrastructure for more general agents, starting with <strong>computer-use agents</strong>.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Yinjie Wang.
